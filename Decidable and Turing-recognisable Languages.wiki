= Turing-recognisability =

    A language is _Turing-recognisable_ iff a TM can be constructed that can
    recognise it.

= Co-Turing-recognisability =

    A language $L$ is _co-Turing-recognisable_ iff its complement $\bar L$
    is Turing-recognisable.

= Decidability =

A language is decidable iff a deciding TM can be constructed that recognises it.

== Decidability Through Recognisability ==

    A language is decidable iff it is Turing-recognisable and co-Turing
    recognisable.

=== Proof ===

If $L$ is decidable, there exists a TM $M_L$ that decides it.
Any decidable language is Turing-recognisable, so $L$ is Turing-recognisable.
A decider for $\bar L$ can be constructed by swapping $M_L$'s invert states, so
$\bar L$ is decidable (and therefore Turing-recognisable) too.
$\bar L$'s Turing-recognisability means $L$ is co-Turing-recognisable.

If $L$ and $\bar L$ are Turing-recognisable, they have recognising TMs
$M_L$ and $M_{\bar L}$, respectively. A TM $M$ can be constructed that simulates
both $M_L$ and $M_{\bar L}$ in parallel, accepting if $M_L$ accepts, and
rejecting if $M_{\bar L}$ accepts. Since either $M_L$ or $M_{\bar L}$ must
accept for every input, $M$ is a decider for $L$. Therefore, $L$ is decidable.
