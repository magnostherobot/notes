= Rice's Theorem =

     Any non-trivial property of the language recognised by a TM is not
     decidable.

A _non-trivial property_ is a property that can be used to tell any two
languages apart; a property that some languages possess and others don't.
A _trivial property_ is possessed by either all languages, or none.
