= Potential Fields =

Potential fields are fields representing costs of a robot moving in
$\mathcal{R}^2$ space.

== Goal Potential ==

Goal potential is a potential varying on the distance to the goal.

== Obstacle Potential ==

Obstacle potential is a potential varying on the distances to the obstacles in
the course. It is often a sum of individual potentials for each obstacles.
These potentials are often based on an inverse of the distance to an obstacle,
to create an asymptotic curve when near (or touching) the obstacle.
