= Rapidly-exploring Random Tree =

A _rapidly-exploring random tree_ is an algorithm that starts with a single
point in free space, then attempts to add randomly-chosen points to the graph.
It checks if these points can be added to the graph by finding the point
currently in the graph nearest to the random point, then checking if an edge
can be made between the two points, satisfying constraints (for exmaple,
physical barriers). If the edge can be made, both it and the random point are
added to the graph.

The maximum length of a new edge may be restricted by a growth factor. If this
restriction causes the distance between a random point its nearest point in the
graph to be uncloseable by a new edge, the random point is replaced by a new
point that is collinear with both original points, but can be connected to the
graph point with an edge. This shows that the random points chosen can be seen
as "deciding" the directon of expansion of the graph. Since there is naturally
more blank space in unexplored areas, random points are chosen in blank areas
more often, and so exploration is pushed toward unexplored areas.
