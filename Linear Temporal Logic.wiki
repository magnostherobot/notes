= Linear Temporal Logic =

Logic that describes the veracity of elements over discrete time.

== LTL Operators ==

There are two primary temporal operators for LTL:
- $\mathcal{X}p$: _next_ $p$.
- $p \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} q$: $p$ _until_ $q$.

There are also operators that can be created from these primary operators that
are used frequently:
- $\square p$: _always_ $p$.
- $\lozenge p$: _eventually_ $p$.

Finally, there are extra operators that can be formed from the primary operators
and are used infrequently, but are convenient at times:
- $p \mathbin{\mathcal{W}} q$: $p$ _weak until_ $q$.
- $p \mathbin{\mathcal{R}} q$: $p$ _weak release_ $q$.
- $p \mathbin{\mathcal{M}} q$: $p$ _strong release_ $q$.

=== Operator Equivalences ===

{{$
\neg \square p &\equiv \lozenge \neg p \\
\lozenge p &\equiv \textrm{true} \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} p \\
\square p &\equiv \textrm{false} \mathbin{\mathcal{R}} p \\
p \mathbin{\mathcal{R}} q &\equiv \neg (\neg p \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} \neg q) \\
p \mathbin{\mathcal{M}} q &\equiv \neg (\neg p \mathbin{\mathcal{W}} \neg q) \\
p \mathbin{\mathcal{W}} q &\equiv
(p \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} q) \lor (\square p) \\
p \mathbin{\mathcal{M}} q &\equiv
(p \mathbin{\mathcal{R}} q) \land (\lozenge p) \\
p \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} q &\equiv
q \lor (q \land \mathcal{X}(p \mathbin{\mathcal{U}} q))
}}$

== Expressing Properties in LTL ==

An invariant $p$ can be expressed as $\square p$.

A _reply_ (that $q$ happens in response to $p$) can be expressed as
$p \rightarrow q$.

A _guaranteed reply_ (that $q$ _always_ happens in response to $p$) can be
expressed as $\square (p \rightarrow q)$.

To check that progress is always made, or that $p$ is infinitely often true,
the LTL $\square \lozenge p$ can be used.

To check for _stability_, that $p$ is eventually always the case,
$\lozenge \square p$ can be used.

_Exclusion_ can be described using LTL as $\square (p \rightarrow \neg q)$.
