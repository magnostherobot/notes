= Context-free Grammars =

Definition:
{{$%align%
G &= (V, \Sigma, R, S) \\
S &\in V
}}$

A context-free grammar $G$ contains a collection of variables $V$, a collection
of terminals $\Sigma$, a set of rules to expand variables into strings of
variables and terminals $R$, and a starting variable $S$.

    A language is context-free iff some pushdown automaton recognises it.
