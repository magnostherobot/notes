= Uniform Cost Search =

A _uniform cost search_ is one where every branch in the game tree has an equal
cost to "move down". The cost to move from the root of the game tree to a
particular node is equal to this node's depth in the tree.

= Best-first Search =

A _best-first search_ is a search algorithm which uses a heuristic to evaluate
the costs of branches in the game tree.

= Greedy Search =

A _greedy search_ is a search algorithm that assumes that the best choice in a
local decision is the best choice generally.

Greedy searches are not complete, as they cannot "go back" on a previously-made
decision.
They are not optimal, since the best choice in a local decision is
_not necessarily_ the best choice generally.

= A* Search =

An _A* search_ is a combination of both a uniform cost search and a greedy
best-first search:
{{$
f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
}}$
where $f(x)$ is the cost of route $x$ in A*, $g(x)$ is its cost in a uniform
cost search, and $h(x)$ is its cost in a greedy best-first search.

An A* search is complete so long as $g(x)$'s costing heuristic is
_inadmissable_ (never estimates a cost higher than the real cost).
It is optimal, and _optimally efficient_ (optimal in the shortest time
possible).
