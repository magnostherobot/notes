= Kleene's Recursive Function Model =

The following are computable:
- functions which return a constant
- functions which return one of their inputs
- successor functions
- compositions of two computable functions
- definitions in terms of already-defined computable functions
- definitions in terms of finding the least value of an already-defined
  computable function
