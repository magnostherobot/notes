= BUG Algorithms =

Bug algorithms are a set of obstacle traversal algorithms inspired by the
movements of insects. The more primitive examples are designed to work with
"tactile" (extermely short-range) sensors.

== Bug 0 ==

Bug 0 algorithms attempt to head directly from a the robot's position to the
goal. If an obstacle is encountered, they navigate around the obstacle closely
until they can head straight towards the goal again.

== Bug 1 ==

Bug 1 algorithms head towards the goal. When an obstacle is encountered, they
navigate around the entire obstacle, recording the point at which they were
closest to the goal. Once circling the obstacle, they navigate around it again
back to the position they recorded as the closest to the goal, and head stright
towards the goal again.

== Bug 2 ==

Bug 2 algorithms draw a straight line from the start point to the goal. When
encountering an obstacle, they encircle it until they meet this drawn line,
at which point they leave the obstacle and follow the line again.

== POTBUG ==

POTBUG algorithms give the robot awareness of its physical radius, preventing it
from heading down areas that would be too tight for it.

=== SMOOTHBUG ===

SMOOTHBUG algorithms enhance POTBUG algorithms by increasing the radius of the
sensors, creating smoother paths.
